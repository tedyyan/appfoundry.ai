# 🚀 Open AI App Platform

An open-source platform for building, extending, and shipping AI-powered mobile apps **fast**.

This project is designed to help developers turn ideas into real, shipped apps without worrying about infrastructure, app store reviews, or deployment complexity.

The platform is open source (Apache-2.0) and community-driven, with the project maintainer handling core infrastructure and app store publishing.

I will try my best to ship the app every month. You build the AI idea. We ship it and make it app-store-ready.

## 📱 Live App (Example Feature)

This open-source platform already powers a production app shipped to real users.

**Example implementation:** *SnapFindMy*  
A smart visual memory assistant built on this platform.

- 🍎 **App Store**  
  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapfindmy/id6748143494

- 🤖 **Google Play**  
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cybersky.snapfindmy

This app demonstrates how ideas built on this platform can move from concept to **App Store & Google Play** with minimal friction.  
It is only one example—contributors are encouraged to build and ship their own features.

## 🌟 Vision

> Build an AI app community where anyone can turn an idea into a real mobile feature—quickly.

Many great ideas never become apps because:
- App Store / Google Play publishing is painful
- Infrastructure costs money and time
- Cross-platform setup is complex
- Solo developers lack distribution

This platform removes those barriers.

## 🧠 What You Can Build

Examples of contributions:
- AI-powered utilities
- Search, memory, or assistant features
- Image, voice, or text-based AI tools
- Productivity workflows
- Experimental AI UX ideas

### Example Feature

**SnapFindMy** is one example feature built on this platform:
