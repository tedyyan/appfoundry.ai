# 🚀 Open AI App Platform

An open-source platform for building, extending, and shipping AI-powered mobile apps **fast**.

This project is designed to help developers turn ideas into real, shipped apps without worrying about infrastructure, app store reviews, or deployment complexity.

The platform is **open source (Apache-2.0)** and community-driven, while the core infrastructure and app store publishing are maintained by the project maintainer.

## 🌟 Vision

> Build an AI app community where anyone can turn an idea into a real mobile feature—quickly.

Many great ideas never become apps because:
- App Store / Google Play publishing is painful
- Infrastructure costs money and time
- Cross-platform setup is complex
- Solo developers lack distribution

This platform removes those barriers.

---

## 🧱 What This Platform Is

- 🧩 A **modular AI app framework**
- 📱 A **cross-platform mobile app** (iOS & Android)
- ☁️ A **hosted backend** (auth, database, storage)
- 🚢 A **monthly release pipeline** to real users

Contributors focus on **features and ideas**.  
The platform handles **shipping and operations**.

---

## 🔓 Open Source Model

- **License**: Apache-2.0
- Anyone can:
  - Add features
  - Extend existing modules
  - Fork and experiment
- The core app stays open
- Infrastructure and publishing are centrally managed

This keeps development open while ensuring fast, stable releases.

## 🧠 What You Can Build

Examples of contributions:
- AI-powered utilities
- Search, memory, or assistant features
- Image, voice, or text-based AI tools
- Productivity workflows
- Experimental AI UX ideas

### Example Feature

**SnapFindMy** is one example feature built on this platform:
- Take a photo
- AI recognizes the object
- Save it
- Search later by text or voice

It demonstrates how quickly ideas can become real features—but it’s just one example.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack (High-Level)

- **Expo** – Cross-platform mobile development
- **Supabase** – Auth, database, storage, APIs
- **AI / Vision APIs** – Feature-dependent
- **No-code / Low-code friendly** architecture

Exact implementations may evolve as the platform grows.
